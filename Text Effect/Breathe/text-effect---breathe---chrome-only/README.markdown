# Text Effect - Breathe - [Chrome only]
 _A Pen created at CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/jhnsnc/pen/BWQOJJ](https://codepen.io/jhnsnc/pen/BWQOJJ).

 This time I wanted to add some motion to text while keeping it fully accessible (go ahead, select/copy/paste the text!) I played around with displacement maps and ended up with this.

Hopefully as I understand these filters better and their cross-browser quirks, I can come up with more performant effects that are still interesting.

NOTE: This probably won't work correctly for browsers other than Chrome. Browsers implement SVG filters differently and this is definitely an experimental use of SVG filters.
